Though not just any classification. We believe that this one pushes the boundaries of
our understanding of patterns that form our cities (and all the other settlements!) into
directions that enable research of many new and old questions we have about
urbanization. Urban Taxonomy divides cities into regions of consistent patterns of urban
form (think about buildings and street layouts, compositions, and configurations) and
connects them via a taxonomic tree. That, in turn, encodes how similar different regions
are.

The details are well outlined at the dedicated site,
[urbantaxonomy.org](https://urbantaxonomy.org). Just a few notes - all of it is open,
from [code](https://github.com/uscuni/urban_taxonomy) to
[data](https://urbantaxonomy.org/data.html). That means that you can either fetch it and
play with it immediately or pull the code and apply the method to your own data. There's
a preprint to read if you are interested in how it works.

If you have any ideas that might involve Urban Taxonomy, give us a shout!
