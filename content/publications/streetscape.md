## abstract

In this paper, we present momepy.streetscape, a new module of the Python library widely used for morphometric analysis, specifically designed to study streetscapes from a pedestrian perspective. The module enables systematic, in-depth analysis of street-based morphology using vector datasets of the built environment. It quantifies features such as street width, façade continuity, and other compositional attributes that shape pedestrian experience and perception. By incorporating streetscape metrics, the expanded momepy functions support interdisciplinary research into how street-level configurations influence social interactions, walkability, and neighborhood vitality.
